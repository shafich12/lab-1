            <td>Media Production Company Database Management System</td>
            <td>Meuse Multimedia is a photography and videography company that aims at providing top notch services with the state-of-the-art media equipment and their highly trained personnel. Nonetheless, due to the high demand of their quality work, they sometimes face challenges when keeping track of their bookings, workers available, the gear that they have to efficiently render their service to the client and client packages that they provided. The database for Meuse Multimedia is intended to keep track of client bookings. The four identified entities will be: photographers available, gear available, client packages which clients can select from and actual bookings.
                <p>There are several professional services that they provide, namely: Portrait Photo Sessions, Corporate Photo Sessions, Architecture Photo Sessions, Engagement and Wedding Photo and Video Coverage, Events Photo and Video Coverage (parties, gatherings, church ceremonies, and more). Primarily, Meuse Multimedia is aimed at providing these services to high-end clients based in Ghana.</p>
                Typically, a way in which a booking is made is, a potential client enters the Meuse Shop, views our digital portfolio for moving stills (videos) and our paperback Photobook, and once they are interested in what they see, they make a booking tailored to what they need by selecting from our existing packages. Our Sales personnel then keys in the client's requirements into our database, checking the availability of the date and who will be able to service their needs. Once that is done, an invoice is generated and sent to the client, requiring the client to make a 60% payment in order to secure the date. A team of two or more photographers and, or videographers is then assigned to that client. Prior to the day, reminders are given to the team that will be covering the photo or video session.
                
                <p>The database aids Meuse Multimedia in:
                    <ul>
                <li>Keeping track of the information relating to the services available to the client.</li>
                <li>Handling actual bookings.</li>
                <li>Which bookings they must cater for next and also the team available, if any, to work on
                the job.</li>
                <li>Avoiding double bookings if they are out of hands for the day.</li>
                <li>Keeping track of gear available and gear in use.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            
                For these reasons stated above, the database will help Meuse Multimedia in handling their high demand and aid them in working efficiently to meet all clients' needs in the best way possible. The important thing about this database is, it will also help Meuse Multimedia in good record keeping.</td>

            <td>Galamsey Monitoring Application in Java</td>
            <td>

            <p>Illegal mining can have devastating effects on natural resources such as vegetation, water bodies and
                land, and although it is known that they are more likely to occur in some places than in others they are
                almost impossible to detect it during its operation. In order to help African security agencies and mining
                authorities understand and detect illegal mining better, an international monitoring system (using drone
                images) is in place to record where “galamsey” occur and how devastating they are in Africa.
                “Galamsey” impact is measured by the ‘vegetation colour’: geographical locations with

                <ul>
                <li>green vegetation is/are identified to have a healthy vegetation with no “galamsey” presence
                (number value 1 is assigned),</li>
                <li>yellow vegetation are identified to have a fair vegetation with a potential “galamsey” presence
                (number value 2 is assigned),</li>
                <li>brown vegetation are identified to have a poor vegetation with a certain “galamsey” presence
                (number value 3 is assigned).</li>
                </ul>
                National “galamsey” observatories record “galamsey” that occur, although different observatories were
                set up at different times, so the period over which historical data is available varies from place to place. </p>
                
                
                <p> For this project, my team and I made use of javaSWING which aids in creating a user interface for the user to enable them to easily navigate through and use all menus/features of the application. 
                    We implemented databases in java (connecting java to database), which goes a long way to show how important databases are and how they can be used practically in such applications.

            <p>For this project I created an application for android mobile phones using 
                MIT App Inventor that can easily generate invoices for a business by taking input such as the item Description, quantity and price, and generates the final invoice by displaying the total amount and who the invoice is for as a pdf file </p>
