    <h1>Shafic Hijazi</h1>
<p>I am Shafic Hijazi, and I am a computer science student at Ashesi. I love programming in html. Tables are a great way to organize 
    your code when programming in HTML and I believe this is what made me fall in love with programming because I saw how powerful it was
    and it made me understand how powerful it was and to also understand how webpages were built. I
    will be graduating in the year 2022. I love taking photographs as a hobby.
I am from Accra in Ghana, West Africa </p>
